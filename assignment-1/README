# Assignment 1 – PC-001  
Producer–Consumer Pattern with Thread Synchronization

This assignment implements a classic Producer–Consumer system using Python threads, condition
variables, and a bounded shared buffer. The goal is to demonstrate correct synchronization,
communication between threads, and clean object-oriented design.

## Approach I Chose

I implemented the Producer–Consumer problem using:

- A **bounded shared buffer** backed by `deque` for O(1) enqueue/dequeue  
- Python’s `Condition` object for **synchronized put/get** operations  
- Separate `Producer` and `Consumer` thread classes  
- A **poison-pill mechanism** (`None`) for graceful shutdown  
- Clear, thread-safe logging showing real-time buffer state

This approach ensures correctness, readability, and deterministic behavior under concurrency.

---

## 🔍 Other Approaches Considered (and Why I Didn’t Choose Them)

### **Approach A: Python’s `queue.Queue`**
`queue.Queue` already provides built-in blocking behavior.

**Why I didn’t use it:**
- The assignment specifically tests understanding of synchronization concepts like `Condition`, `wait()`, and `notify_all()`.
- Using `Queue` would hide those mechanisms.
### **Approach B: Using Semaphores Instead of Condition Variables**
A semaphore-based solution is possible.

**Why not:**
- Semaphores alone make it harder to keep buffer access strictly synchronized.
- Condition variables provide clearer producer/consumer semantics.

**Conclusion:**  
The chosen design has the best balance between correctness, clarity, and meeting assignment requirements.

**Selected approach demonstrates explicit control over concurrency** via condition variables, matching the assignment’s intent.

tradeoffs - harder to maintain, more manual logic and error-prone

### **Key Components**

#### +`SharedBuffer`
Implements a bounded buffer with:

- Internal `deque`
- `put()` blocking when full  
- `get()` blocking when empty  
- `Condition` for producer/consumer coordination  
- `snapshot()` for debug-friendly buffer visualization

#### + `Producer`
- Reads from `SourceContainer`
- Calls `buffer.put(item)`
- Logs every step with buffer state
- Sends `None` as a poison pill on completion

#### + `Consumer`
- Reads using `buffer.get()`
- Stores values in `DestinationContainer`
- Stops cleanly on receiving `None`

#### + `main.py`
Runs a full example with 5 items and prints final results.

### Wait/Notify Mechanism
- **Producer waiting:** If the buffer is full, the producer calls `condition.wait()` and releases the lock.
- **Consumer notification:** After consuming an item, the consumer calls `condition.notify_all()` to wake sleeping producers.
- **Consumer waiting:** If the buffer is empty, the consumer calls `condition.wait()` and releases the lock.
- **Producer notification:** After producing an item, the producer calls `condition.notify_all()` to wake sleeping consumers.

#### Note:
Why I used `deque` instead of `queue.Queue` or a `list`:

- `deque` gives O(1) append/pop operations and allows explicit control over synchronization, which the assignment requires.

- `queue.Queue` is already synchronized internally, so using it would hide the wait/notify logic and defeat the purpose of demonstrating thread coordination manually.

## ▶️ How to Run
```
cd assignment-1 
./run.sh demo      # Run concurrency demo
./run.sh test      # Run unit tests
./run.sh clean      # cleans your env
```
The script automatically creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies.

## Test Suite Explanation

Your test suite covers **every critical correctness dimension**:

### ✔ Basic Flow Tests
- All items transferred in order  
- Handles empty sources correctly  

### ✔ Buffer Condition Tests
- Behavior when buffer size = 1  
- Behavior when buffer > dataset size  

### ✔ Ordering + Poison Pill
- Ensures FIFO correctness  
- Ensures `None` is **not** stored in destination  

### ✔ Stress Tests
- 300-item workload  
- Random producer/consumer jitter to mimic real concurrency  
- Verifies system is stable under timing variability  

The coverage demonstrates correctness under normal, edge, and stress conditions.

## Assumptions

1. Shutdown uses a single poison pill because only one consumer exists.  We can use `.notify_all()` when multiple consumer exists.
2. `SourceContainer` supplies items in FIFO order.  
3. Buffer capacity is fixed at initialization.  
4. Logging is for demonstration and not required in production.
